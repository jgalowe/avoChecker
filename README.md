 playing around with a CNN to predict avocado quality

 Notes:
 Avocados are still rated on a scale of 0-5, but I have changed the folders to be 0-10 just to match how the regression treats each folder. In this code, a 9 for example would actually be a 4.5 - in the website this won't be an issue as users will not see scores out of 10 as scores will be dividied by 2
